Update Boost to v1.89.0

Resolved Issues With Xcode26.1, this framework was built with Xcode16.1.

This supports the following platforms:

* iphoneos/arm64
* iphonesimulator/arm64
* iphonesimulator/x86_64
* macosx/arm64
* macosx/x86_64

## Fixed issues

* Detection of the platform libiconv to support building the locale library.
* Added the boost container library.

## Deprecations:

The x86_64 iphonesimulator architecture is not built on MacOSX Tahoe (Xcode26+)
